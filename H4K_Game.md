## Chapter 1: First steps

## Chapitre 1: premiers pas

<b>Step 1: Setting up a background</b>  
The first step will teach you how you use a sprite as a platform to juggle the ball

<b>Etape 1: mise en place de l'arrière-plan</b>
Cette première étape explique comment utiliser un "lutin" comme une plateforme pour jongler avec la balle.

      <b>Activity Checklist</b>
   - [ ]  Start a new Scratch and delete the cat sprite so that your project is empty. Right click the cat sprite in the sprite area below the project area
  
      <b>Liste des activités</b>
    - [ ]  Commence un nouveau projet Scratch: supprime le lutin "chat" pour que ton nouveau projet soit vierge. Clique droit sur le chat dans "l'espace du lutin" en dessous de la fenêtre qui montre le résultat de ton projet.

![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Del_Cat_franc.png)


   - [ ]  Change the background of the stage to black. In order to do this, click on the stage to the left of the sprite area.
   
   - [ ]  Met un arrière-plan noir. Pour ce faire, clique sur "scène" à gauche de l'espace du lutin"

![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Stage_fr.png)

   - [ ] After that, click on the paint tool (bucket) to fill the background.
   
   - [ ] Ensuite, clique sur le pot de peinture pour le remplissage de l'arrière-plan.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Palette.png)

   - [ ] Select the black color from the palette below.
   
   - [ ] Sélectionne la couleur noire depuis la palette de couleurs au bas de l'écran. 
 
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Colours.png)

   - [ ] Now, with the bucket tool and black as colour selected, simply click into the big white area that you see on the right side of your screen. The result should look like this.  
   
   - [ ] Now, with the bucket tool and black as colour selected, simply click into the big white area that you see on the right side of your screen. The result should look like this.  
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Backdrop.png)

<b>Step 2: Creating the platform</b>
   
   - [ ] The juggling game needs a platform to bounce the ball off of. In this step  we're creating this platform, which in our case simply consists of the letter D. This letter, when the game starts, will go into position and act as platform! 
 
   - [ ] Create a new sprite by clicking on the brush symbol above the sprite area.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/New_Sprite_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/New_Sprite_fr.png)

   - [ ] Now in the backdrop area on the right (The same area, where you painted the background black), you want to select the Text tool.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Backdrop_Text.png)

   - [ ] Select white as coulour in the colour palette. (Both squares on the left of the colour palette are white)
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Colour_White.png)

   - [ ] Now click into the area in the middle to open a text box. Enter a capital D. You do this by holding shift and then pressing the letter D. 
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Keyboard.png)
   
   - [ ] Since the D sprite is white it may seem invisible at first but it's there. Now, unselect the D sprite by clicking anywhere else in this area. If you do this, a bunch of rectangles and dots are going to appear on the D sprite.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/D_Grid.png)

   - [ ]  Select, the diagonal rectangles and drag them to make the D sprite bigger. Should you accidently unselect the D sprite or you're unsatisfied with the size, click on the little undo arrow that is pointing to the left, at the top part of this area.  
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Undo.png)
   
   - [ ]  If you're satisfied with the size of the D sprite, click anywhere in the area again to unselect it and make it appear in your project area on the left side.
   
   - [ ] Your project should now look like this.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Project1.png)

<b>Step 3: Creating the Ball</b>

   - [ ] The game obviously needs a ball which we are going to create now. Create a new sprite, just like you did with the letter D.  
   
   - [ ] Before, we used the bucket and the text tool. This time we are going to use the circle tool.  
   
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Select_Ball.png)

   - [ ] Select a green colour in the colour palette. To the left of the colour palette you also want to select the "fill" option for the ball. This means that we aren't just drawing the outlines, but the full ball.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Ball_Fill.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Colour_Green.png)

   - [ ] Now, inside the area on the right, hold shift and the left mouse button, then drag the mouse to create a ball. The reason why you want to hold shift, is because it forces a perfectly round ball, without shift it may turn into an egg!
   
   - [ ] From here on out it's the same as with the D sprite, release the mouse button and click somewhere in this area to finish the creation of the ball, just like with the D sprite, the ball should appear inside the project area on the right as well.
   
   - [ ] Your project should look similar to this.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Project2.png)

   - [ ] Before we move on to the programing, there's one more step required later on, that we should configure now.
  
<b>Step 4: Sprite Center</b>
   
   - [ ]  We  have to set the costume center. Select the D sprite, then, in the far right corner, you will see a cross symbol. select it.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Costume_Center_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Costume_Center_fr.png)

   - [ ] Go into the area with the cross, then hold your left mouse button and drag the cross in the bottom left corner of the D sprite. If you can't see the D sprite well enough or if you're shaking too much, try zooming further in, by clicking on the magnifying glass in the bottom right of this area.
  
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Magn_Glass.png)

   - [ ] You want to put the cross right here.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/D_Cross.png)

   - [ ] Now let go off of the left mouse button, the position of the D will change but that's fine. This happens because you changed where the center of the D sprite is.
   
   - [ ] Remember to use the undo function if something happened (i.e. The D disappeared).
   
   - [ ] Next, do the same with the Ball. The difference here is that you want to put the cross right in the middle of the ball. This should be easier than with the D sprite.
   
   - [ ] Now we got a propper set-up. Let's move on to the programing part shall we?
      
   
## Chapter 2: Basic juggling game

<b>Step 1: Transform the D sprite into a platform</b>

   - [ ] Once the game starts (When you click on the green flag above the project area). We want the D sprite to float torwards the bottom and become the platform we juggle the ball with.
   
   - [ ] We were working in the costume tab of the sprites, now we're changing to the script tab. This is where we put the code.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Tabs_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Tabs_fr.png)

   - [ ] The script window should look like this:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Scripts_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Scripts_fr.png)

   - [ ] Now, let's make the code, that will let the D sprite spin and float. Select the D sprite and copy the following code:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/D_Turn_Code_fr.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/D_Turn_Code_en.png)

   - [ ] In order to completely write this code, a new variable has to be made. Click on Make a Variable under the Data option and call it "Degrees". Make sure to uncheck the variable after you created it, otherwise we will always see its value on screen and we don't want that.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Variable_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Variable_fr.png)

   - [ ] Once you click on the green flag above the project window, the D sprite should float slightly torwards the bottom of the area and at the same time to a 90 degree spin to the right.
   
   - [ ] Explanation of the code: When we click on the green flag, we set the D sprite to a specific x and y position which is somewhere in the middle. The x axis is basically the horizontal axis, where as the y axis is the vertical axis. If you move your mouse through the project area, you can see the axis of your mouse in the bottom right of the project area.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/axis.png)

   - [ ] The pointing into direction part means it's pointing straight right. 0 would mean it would face straight upwards.
   
   - [ ] Then we set the "Degrees" variable we previously created to 0, meaning we reset it every time we reset the game.
   
   - [ ] The big "repeat until" thing that surrounds other code is a loop, meaning whatever is inside is being repeated until the criteria is met. In other words, we repeatedly turn the D sprite by 1 degree to the right and then add 1 to the "Degrees" value until the variable "Degrees" equals 90. Simply put, we turn the D sprite 90 times by 1 degree really fast. After 90 times, the variable "Degrees" has the value 90, so the loop criteria is met and it stops.
   
   - [ ] From a seperate starting point we then let the D sprite glide for 3 seconds to a predetermined point closer to the bottom of the project area. This has to be seperate because if we add it to the first block of code it will either turn or glide first, then do the other.  This way it does both at the same time.
   
<b>Step 2: Make a bouncing ball</b>

   - [ ] Select the ball sprite and add the following code to let your ball freely jump around: 
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Base_Ball_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Base_Ball_fr.png)

   - [ ] Explanation of the code: When the flag is being clicked, we set the speed to the base value 8, you probably already guessed that this is a new variable you have to create, just like you did with "Degrees".

   - [ ] Then, just like with the D sprite, you assign a fixed position, that the ball will always return to when clicked on the green flag.
   
   - [ ] We let the ball face a random directon from -30 degrees to +30 degrees, which is basicly a cone facing straight up.
   
   - [ ] Then we wait 3 seconds. We do this so the ball doesn't start bouncing before the D sprite is in position.
   
   - [ ] Inside another loop, simply a loop that lasts forever as it says on it, we let the ball move at "speed" steps, so in other words 8, since we set the "speed" to 8 in the beginning.
   
   - [ ] And of course we let it bounce with the next line of code whenever it hits a wall.
   
<b> Step 3: Collision & Movement</b>

   - [ ] Let's program controls for the platform and that whenever the ball touches the platform it bounces off.
   
   - [ ] Select the D sprite and add the following code to add controls to the platform, so you can move it left and right:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Controls_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Controls_fr.png)

   - [ ] Explanation of the code: After the game starts we wait 3 seconds first, to let the platform glide into position.
   
   - [ ] Now in a forever loop, we use a if statement, meaning that if something happens, something else is being executed. In this case we check "forever" since it's in a loop that if "left arrow" is being pressed, we change x, so the horizontal axis by -7 to move the platform to the righ. It's obviously the exact opposite if we want to move to the right, just that the x value here has to be positive.

   - [ ] Select the ball sprite and add the following code to the code from before to let the ball bounce off of the platform:
   
   ![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Ball_Bounce_en.png)
   ![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Ball_Bounce_fr.png)
   
   - [ ] The game should be playable now.... Somewhat. The Ball is probably going to react strangely upon collision with the platform or even the edge. The reason for this is because we check for collision with something white and the edge of the arena is white too.
   
   - [ ] Explanation of the code: We added a if statement that if the colour of the D sprite (white) is being touched then we change the direction to a random number somewhere in a cone facing upwards, additionally, we increase the speed slightly, so the ball becomes faster and faster.
   
<b>Step 4: Refining ball bouncing</b>

   - [ ] Since the bouncing ball seems to be a bit out of control, let's add some additional code, to make the collision and bouncing a bit smoother.
   
   - [ ] Add a new sprite. This new sprite should be a yellow line that should be about 1 pixel wide and 7 pixel long. Pixels are shown as grey/white rectangles in the costumes window if you zoom in as shown in the picture below.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Yellow_Bar.png)

   - [ ] Next, do the same as above, but this time make it a blue bar. For both, set the costume center cross to their bottom right just like you did with the D sprite.
   
   - [ ] Now, we want to add some code to those bars. Add the following code to the blue bar.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Blue_Bar_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Blue_Bar_fr.png)

   - [ ] You probably noticed that this code is similar to the one that lets the D sprite turn and float down, this code essentially does the same with the blue bar, just that the bar is first invisible and appears once the platform is in position.
   
   - [ ]  Now you want to add the same code to the yellow bar, since this bar isn't at the exact same position, we have to change the output position slightly as shown here:

![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Yellow_Bar_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Yellow_Bar_fr.png)

   - [ ] Next up, we change the previous collision detection from white to blue, and then add another collision detection for yellow.

![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Bounce_Bars_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Bounce_Bars_fr.png)

   - [ ] The only difference between these 2, is the angle. The different numbers mean that if the yellow bar is hit, the ball bounces off more torwards the right and if the blue one is hit, the ball bounces off more to the left.
   
   - [ ] The last thing missing, are the controls for these, since they're essentially stuck to the D sprite, we literally just copy the controls from the D sprite and paste them into the yellow and blue bar sprite code section (use drag and drop for this).
   
   - [ ] You should have a basic juggling game now!
   
## Chapter 3: Upgrade

<b>Step 1: Lava floor</b>

   - [ ] We have the base now, but there is no goal or purpose to the game just yet.
   
   - [ ] Usually, in these kind of games, you have to make sure the ball doesn't pass the platform or else you lose. So let's start by programing a dead zone.
   
   - [ ] Create a new sprite just like you did before. Pick the rectangle tool.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Rectangle.png)

   - [ ] Since the dead zone is supposed to be dangerous, pick the colour red to make it look like lava.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Rectangle_Colour.png)

   - [ ] Also, remember to make it a full rectangle, not just the outlines.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Bounce_Bars_fr.png)

   - [ ] Now, draw a rectangle, just like you drew all the figures before.
   
   - [ ] Once you drew the rectangle you'll see the little squares again to adjust the size, make it as big as possible to make sure it'll fill the screen. Once you unselect the rectangle it will appear in the project area on the left, drag it torwards the bottom, to make it look like there's a lava floor.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Lava_Floor.png)

<b>Step 2: Game Over</b>

   - [ ] Since the game has to end at one point, let's add code, which when the ball touches the lava, initiates a Game Over screen and ends the game.
   
   - [ ] In order to do the next bit, we have to look into broadcasts first:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Broad_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Broad_fr.png)

   - [ ] This lets you braodcast specific signals. Broadcasting means, you are sending the message stating in the broadcast throughout your entire code. Then on any sprite, you can program code, that will only get executed, once a specific broadcast signal is received.
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Broad2_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Broad2_fr.png)

   - [ ] Go back to this code on the ball sprite:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Bounce_Bars_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Bounce_Bars_fr.png)

   - [ ] Now after the 2 if statements but still inside the forever loop, add the following code:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Touch_Lava_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Touch_Lava_fr.png)

   - [ ] We're broadcasting a bunch of different statements which we are going to use soon. We then wait 2 seconds and then the ball will glide back to its beginning position then we wait another 5 seconds for everything to end and then we end the entire code.
   
   - [ ] Add a new sprite. Make it white Text like you did before with the D sprite. Write "Game Over" in white. You can make this bigger too. Then put it in the middle of the screen.
   
   - [ ] It should look like this:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/End.png)

   - [ ] Now choose that new Game Over sprite and add this code to it:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Loss_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Loss_fr.png)

   - [ ] Explanation of the code: The way this works is that we programmed in the ball sprite, that if the ball hits the colour red, so in other words the lava, it sends a broadcast with the message "loss" to every part of the code. Now in the Game Over sprite, we programmed that when the message "loss" is received it makes Game Over visible. So the Game Over is always there, it's just invisible until you actually lose, then it appears.
   
   - [ ] With this code, when the game ends, the platform is still movable, let's change that.
   
   - [ ] Go back to the script in the ball sprite. See the "key stop", "blue" and "yellow" broadcasts? We are going to use those now. To stop everything after the game ends.
   
   - [ ] Go to the blue bar sprite and add this code:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Blue_End_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Blue_End_fr.png)

   - [ ] Do the same for the yellow bar:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Yellow_End_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Yellow_End_fr.png)

   - [ ] And add this code to the D sprite:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/D_End_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/D_End_fr.png)

   - [ ] Explanation of the code: Once it receives the broadcast it stops all the other blocks of code in this sprite. This means that the block where we programmed the controls is going to stop working. Then it waits 2 seconds and finally puts the D sprite back into its initial position.
   
<b>Step 4: Score and Timer</b>

   - [ ] Finally, lets add a timer, the current score and the top score to the game.
   
   - [ ] Create 3 new variables: Time, Score, Top Score. Make sure the box next to them is checked..
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Fin_Var.png)
   
   - [ ] They will now appear in your project area. Move them wherever you want.
   
   - [ ] Now go back to the big block of code in the ball sprite, and add this to the top of the code:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Ball_Ini_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Ball_Ini_fr.png)

   - [ ] This sets the score to 0 and the timer to 60 when a new game begins.
   
   - [ ] Now we add 3 more blocks of code to the ball sprite.
   
   - [ ] The first one is the following:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Timer_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Timer_fr.png)

   - [ ] This code is responsible for how the timer works.
   
   - [ ]  Explanation of the code: After 3 seconds the timer starts ticking down, until the ball hits the lava. Inside the loop we wait 1 second and then change the time by -1. Since it's a loop this means that every second the timer is going down by 1. Then the if statement if "Time" is equal to 0, so if the timer hits 0 it executes the same broadcasts that end the game as if we touched the lava, so it's saying we lost basically.
   
   - [ ] Next we save the top score with the following code:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Score_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Score_fr.png)

   - [ ] Explanation of code: The if statement checks that when the game ends, if the current score is higher than the top score, the top score will become what the current score was.
   
   - [ ] The final bit of code is this:
   
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Stop_en.png)
![title](https://github.com/JeyAl/internship/blob/master/Scratch_Images/Stop_fr.png)

   - [ ] All the extra functions should work now. Your complete juggling game is now done!
